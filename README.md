This is a simple C# console application to benchmark string concatenation performance.

## What it does

- Performs 3 tests, each concatenating an empty string 300,000 times
- Measures execution time of each test with Stopwatch
- Prints out execution time in milliseconds for each test
- Calculates and prints average time of all 3 tests

## How to use

- Open the solution in Visual Studio 
- Run the project
- It will output benchmark results and execution times
- Add your system's results by editing the "Test Results" section

## Test Results

You can add your system's specs and execution times.

## Interpreting Results
